# Clothes Combat

NOTE to those seeing this commit to the repo:

To explain my lack of commits lately, I have been working on a personal project that I later decided to publish for my portfolio. That being this, which is still very far from finished. The current state of it is 'probably functional' as I recently restructured everything from my original design with separate react projects for the client and session instead of putting them together. So some new bugs may arise.

Also I'll note this is my first attempt at anything backend, and thus fullstack. I haven't studied backend like I have frontend so my only goal for this right now is to get it functional to use, but I may come back and improve it later once I've learned those skills properly. Still this has taught me a lot about node and express and I think that it's given me ground to stand on when it comes to learning backend development, as well as a better grasp of how the front connects to the back.

In the case of any legal issues, this project does take inspiration from Jackbox Games' TeeK, but all of the code and assets are entirely built from scratch (with the exception of a current placeholder shirt image taken from TeeKO, but this will be replaced once I fully implement that feature). I don't intent to make any profit from this or take any potential profits from the original in anyway, it is simply a web development challenge I took upon myself, as well as a personal spin on a game I enjoy playing with my friends.


```TLDR; not been any GH commits lately cause I was doing this personal project. backend isn't great cause I'm not a backend dev, but I've learned enough to make it functional. IIt's far from done, so I'm still working on it, this is just an early functional version that can be tested online. also don't sue me :)```
