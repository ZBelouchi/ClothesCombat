# Clothes Combat

NOTE to those seeing this commit to the repo:

I've been working on this personal project for a while but decided to add it to my work portfolio along the way, but I wanted to get it to a certain point before I published it. This will explain why my github commits have been lacking lately, I've been working on this locally without publishing a repo. It's still a long way from done, but I had to restructure all of the code as I originally built it with the session and client pages as separate react projects, so I needed to combine them into the merged structure you'll see here. Also as this was just done there's likely that despite my testing some new bugs may appear.

Also it should be noted that this is my first attempt at anything backend, and thus anything fullstack. It wasn't a serious attempt at learning these trades as currently I only specialize in front end, but it was a personal project I wanted to make for fun, and in doing so I came to learn a lot about NodeJS and backend servers. I don't wish to use this as evidence for a proficiency in backend development as I wouldn't my work there was messy at best, but I would say that I at least have a foundation in Nodejs and have a better understanding of how HTTP requests work on both clients and servers than those who have never tried it. There is no database, all active gameplay data is stored in memory. Once I learn proper backend development, I may come back and touch things up, but until then functional is good enough.

Also in the case of any legal issues, this project does take inspiration from Jackbox Games' TeeKo game, but all of the code and assets are entirely built from scratch (with the exception of a current placeholder shirt image taken from TeeKO, but this will be replaced once I fully implement that feature). I don't intent to make any profit from this or take any potential profits from the original in anyway, it is simply a web development challenge I took upon myself, as well as a personal spin on a game I enjoy playing with my friends.

The current state of this project is essentially 'functional', it isn't good, and it's barely playable, but it's enough to test the game over a server to confirm the basic functionality is all in order. I am continuing to finish this so that I can play it myself.

```TLDR; not been any GH commits lately cause I was doing this personal project. backend isn't great cause I'm not a backend dev, but I've learned enough to make it functional. IIt's far from done, so I'm still working on it, this is just an early functional version that can be tested online. also don't sue me```
