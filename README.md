# Clothes Combat

## Changes
* converted shirt component to use SVG to improve how other parts can use it
* added infrastructure for animations, but it's not great since I'm still learning the framermotion, not in effect atm but will revise and impliment later
* added timer, but still needs some fallbacks for various things can go wrong in a game
* lots of code improvements here and there
* other stuff I forgot about, took a break from this project for a while so the stuff I did before then isn't fresh

Code is still very much WIP and messy, and UI is purely for testing functionality. don't worry the code and layout will be much better when I actually go through and fix it up, but that's gonna be after I make sure most of the features are in place and working.


NOTE to those seeing this commit to the repo:

To explain my lack of commits lately, I have been working on a personal project that I later decided to publish for my portfolio. That being this, which is still very far from finished. The current state of it is 'probably functional' as I recently restructured everything from my original design with separate react projects for the client and session instead of putting them together. So some new bugs may arise.

Also I'll note this is my first attempt at anything backend, and thus fullstack. I haven't studied backend like I have frontend so my only goal for this right now is to get it functional to use, but I may come back and improve it later once I've learned those skills properly. Still this has taught me a lot about node and express and I think that it's given me ground to stand on when it comes to learning backend development, as well as a better grasp of how the front connects to the back.

In the case of any legal issues, this project does take inspiration from Jackbox Games' TeeKO, but all of the code and assets are entirely built from scratch. I don't intent to make any profit from this or take any potential profits from the original in anyway, it is simply a web development challenge I took upon myself, as well as a personal spin on a game I enjoy playing with my friends.


```TLDR; not been any GH commits lately cause I was doing this personal project. backend isn't great cause I'm not a backend dev, but I've learned enough to make it functional. IIt's far from done, so I'm still working on it, this is just an early functional version that can be tested online. also don't sue me :)```
